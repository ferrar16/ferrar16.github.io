<p>This is a concealed or stealth cell tower. Concealed cell towers are some of the less common and more unorthodox towers that can be built. They are usually built around the constraints of zoning laws and are more expensive due to the wider assortment of materials that may need to be acquired for their construction. Heights are unscpecific, but they are known to typically manage less tennents than other more common cell towers.</p>
