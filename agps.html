		<p>AGPS (Assisted GPS) functions similarly to GPS, but through a different process. Rather than a recieve information directly from GPS satellites, an AGPS enabled device recieves satellite information from a database. In the case of your cellphone, an AGPS enabled device, it would gather satellite information from the network provider.</p>

		<p>As far as determining location goes with AGPS, recieving satellite informaion via a database is not enough. The information provided through those means is enough to give you an accurate time, but as the satellites nor database are providing you with the means to trilaterate your position, another process and database is needed. Again, with your phone as an example, cell towers provide your phone's AGPS with the necessary location data and act as satellites providing the relative distance phone is from the cell tower. Trilatertion on this scale though is heavy on cell bandwidth as the calculations for this are quite complex.</p>
